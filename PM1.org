** Users and Characteristics
- The primary intended user of ProjectKi is an engineer, drafter, technician, or
  any other member of a small technical team managing the parts and pieces of an
  engineering project.
- Most likely, these primary users would include mechanical, electrical, process
  control and project engineers and their managers.
- From the software's perspective, there is only one user-type, as there are no
  functions of the software that need to be different from one user to the next.
- In practice, different users may be responsible for different tasks in using
  the software.
  - For example, a management or accounting person may have the responsibility
    of populating the vendor and supplier database tables, an electrical drafter
    may then generate a Bill of Materials for their current project, and then a
    purchasing manager may generate and distribute the Purchase Orders.
- The tool is generally used to generate business and logistics documents, so the
  secondary user is the recipient of the generated documentation.
- The recipients of Bills of Materials are intended to include:
  - Engineers and drafters responsible for reviewing the final parts lists
    against project drawings.
  - Project managers responsible for approving expenditures.
  - Shipping and receiving staff to check-list project shelving.
- The recipients of the Purchase Orders are expected to be:
  - Internal purchasing agents and departments.
  - External suppliers/vendors.
** Operating Environment
- ProjectKi is intended to reside within a small internal company network as a
  tool which is quickly accessible to employees onsite in the same subnet.
- Much of the engineering and manufacturing world is dominated by Microsoft, so
  it is most likely that this tool would be hosted on a network attached Windows box:
  - The operating system should be Microsoft Server 2003 or higher.
  - At least Dual Core 3.6 MHz CPU.
  - At least 1 gigabytes of storage.
    - Microsoft Access is limited to a 1 gigabyte database size and ProjectKi is a
      potential Access alternative, so requires a 1 gigabyte minimum to match.
